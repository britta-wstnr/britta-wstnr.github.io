      <description>New series: Explaining papers [#1]
Lately, we published a new paper on estimating functional connectivity from electrophysiological data (Westner, Kujala, Gross, &amp;amp; Schoffelen, 2024). Let me give you a short description of what we did!
Estimating functional connectivity from electrophysiological (i.e., EEG or MEG) data means that one wants to see if any brain areas show activity that is somehow synchronised (although this synchronisation can be shifted in time: think of two people clapping together or clapping alternatingly - both is considered a synchronisation in the neuroscience world).</description>

      <title>Tips for teaching data analysis tutorials and workshops</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I gave a workshop for Cutting Gardens tutors on how to teach MNE-Python. It was my first time teaching such a &amp;ldquo;meta workshop&amp;rdquo; - and below I am sharing some of the tips and thoughts I came up with during preparation. Part of it will be MNE-Python-specific, some of it should apply to any software workshop.
What should happen before the tutorial takes place? There is a few key points that should happen before the tutorial takes place:</description>

      <description>There is a new content page on my website that links resources which I have created. At this point, it contains lectures and teaching material for MEG and EEG data analysis - but I will keep updating it whenever I create any new teaching material or tutorials.
If M/EEG data analysis is something you want to learn more about: go check it out here!</description>

      <description>From 2020 to 2022, I was funded by a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship of the EU Horizon 2020 scheme. This allowed me to join the lab of Prof. Floris de Lange at the Donders Institute at the Radboud University in Nijmegen to research visual anticipation and its relation to memory. Unfortunately, this fellowship was overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, so progress on the project was a little slower than anticipated.</description>

Hi!
I am Britta Westner, a teaching fellow (Tenure Track) at the Donders Institute and Radboudumc in The Netherlands. Here, I am working in the department of Cognitive Neuroscience.
My current research focuses mainly on the intersection of language and memory and I am closely working together with the lab of Assoc.-Prof. VitÃ³ria Piai. Since my background is in visual neuroscience, I am naturally also interested in the intersection of language and vision.</description>

      <description>On this page, I am collecting some resources that I created, mostly for data analysis of MEG and EEG data.
Source reconstruction of M/EEG data For the lab of VitÃ³ria Piai, I am creating a source reconstruction pipeline in FieldTrip. Not quite a tutorial, but with many explanatory comments in the text. Geared towards the data we handle in the lab, but I tried to make it clear if something is Donders-specific, so it might still be a good place to get started.</description>
